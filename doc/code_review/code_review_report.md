Try your best not to double-review a single file

Code Review - Zixuan: Dashboard.js, Home.js, OrderListItem.js, ConfirmationListItem.js

Code Review - Jiashu: documentation, GroupOrder.js, Login.js, UserProfile.js

Documentation: The documentation is quite clear and concise with what it is expressing, and all the required information to run the app seems to be present. The only thing that might be improved is making it more clear in the README what the environmental variables are, and where exactly to put them. I made a few small changes to better reflect the current state of our app, including restoring the .env.example file, which had been removed previously, and adding the new .env file for the client into the .env section. I also took a look at the API documentation, which seems to be quite spartan, but it conveys the needed information quickly if the user does a ctrl+f to find a specific endpoint or such.

GroupOrder.js: The file itself is quite large, but I am unsure if it can be reduced in size at all: each function relates to the management of a group order, and placing them all in one location allows for certain variables and functions to be reused, avoiding redundant code. This file was actually previously refactored from four files, into one, since the separate portions were so interconnected. In general, it seems to follow our design principles, as well as our general app design. The only thing that might be confusing is the functions that return HTML/React elements. Looking further down the file, this is actually a way to avoid redundant code, as each function is used multiple times. To make these less confusing, I added comments to each of them explaining their use, which would certainly make it easier for future developers. At a quick glance, most of the naming is quite good. The only thing that stumped me was that showModal doesn't explain which modal it displays: however, I later found that this was a way to display multiple types of notification modals using one base function, so there doesn't need to be dozens of modal variables throughout the file, which is a good design choice. Overall, the file would not be difficult to understand for developers, but it might take a minute or two to process where each piece fits in. Each of the functions reflects the simplest way to achieve a certain functionality that we chose in the design, and there is very little, if anything, that is unnecessary or overly complex. I also made sure to remove some comments that would most likely not be followed-up on, just to improve the presentation of the file.

Login.js: The file itself is simple, but still quite compact, and does not take up more space than it needs. In general, it seems to follow our design principles, as well as our general app design. The functions all seem to be highly interconnected in their function, and nothing stands out as unnecessary or overly complex. In fact, each function is simple to understand. The naming conventions are also easily understandable, as they reflect their uses exactly. There are a few comments, which are quite informative, but I added a few for good measure where they might be needed. The file is definitely understandable for any developers looking at it, since this was my first time looking at it, and I understood perfectly what each part means. I also removed some commented out sections of code that were no longer necessary. 

UserProfile.js: Similar to Login, the file is quite simple and compact. In general, it seems to follow our design principles, as well as our general app design. The few functions are basic and understandable. The functions all seem to be highly interconnected in their function, and nothing stands out as unnecessary or overly complex. The naming conventions are also very good for a form, as there are many fields, and some fields that are similar to each other. However, I was able to distinguish each variable/React element and match it with its counterpart in the client. The file is a bit long and has many repeated portions of code to render each input text box, which may be unavoidable due to the nature of having a form with about a dozen unique fields to keep track of. The amount of repetitive code was actually reduced, by using one function to set each useState variable, which was a very smart way of avoiding having a dozen setter functions and variables set up in the same file. The file is very easy to understand, and future developers would not have any difficulty understanding.

Code Review - Shichang: OrderItem.css, Admin.js, Checkout.js, CreateGroup.js

OrderItem.css: The code is straightforward and easy to follow. The CSS classes are well-named, indicating their function. CSS and HTML typically don't have automated tests like backend code. Regarding naming, class names like .menu-button, .order-box are clear and descriptive. There are no comments , but CSS and HTML are often self-explanatory. The code follows common CSS practices, with consistent indentation and spacing. Jiashu is the main coder for this file.

Admin.js: The structure of your Admin component demonstrates a clear and logical layout, integrating a sidebar, navbar, and footer which indicates thoughtful design. However, there's a potential for further improvement in the component's architecture. The Admin component appears to handle multiple responsibilities, including layout management, scroll effect logic, and route handling. This multi-faceted approach might lead to challenges in scalability and maintainability. It could be beneficial to break down the Admin component into smaller, more focused components, enhancing readability and reusability fi the project grows larger. While the naming convention used in the code is consistent and clear, some variable names, such as ps, lack descriptiveness. More expressive names would enhance the code's readability and maintainability. Additionally, the code would benefit from comments, especially in complex sections. Descriptive comments would provide valuable context and make the code more accessible to other developers, particularly in explaining the logic behind the scroll effect and route handling. In all, the Admin component is well-constructed with a clear layout and logical integration of various elements.

Checkout.js: The Checkout component effectively utilizes React hooks for managing state and side effects, which aligns well with modern React practices. The data fetching within useEffect is appropriately placed for component mounting, but maybe we should add some error handling for a better user experience. It is a large file with amny lines of code with many inline styling. Managing these through React's state or CSS classes would be more appropriate and maintainable. The current state of the code lacks comments, which are vital for explaining complex logic and ensuring that the codebase is understandable to other developers or for future reference. Ethan was the main coder for this file.
