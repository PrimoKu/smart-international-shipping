Try your best not to double-review a single file

### Code Review - Jiashu: documentation, GroupOrder.js, Login.js, UserProfile.js

- Documentation: The documentation is quite clear and concise with what it is expressing, and all the required information to run the app seems to be present. The only thing that might be improved is making it more clear in the README what the environmental variables are, and where exactly to put them. I made a few small changes to better reflect the current state of our app, including restoring the .env.example file, which had been removed previously, and adding the new .env file for the client into the .env section. I also took a look at the API documentation, which seems to be quite spartan, but it conveys the needed information quickly if the user does a ctrl+f to find a specific endpoint or such.

- GroupOrder.js: The file itself is quite large, but I am unsure if it can be reduced in size at all: each function relates to the management of a group order, and placing them all in one location allows for certain variables and functions to be reused, avoiding redundant code. This file was actually previously refactored from four files, into one, since the separate portions were so interconnected. In general, it seems to follow our design principles, as well as our general app design. The only thing that might be confusing is the functions that return HTML/React elements. Looking further down the file, this is actually a way to avoid redundant code, as each function is used multiple times. To make these less confusing, I added comments to each of them explaining their use, which would certainly make it easier for future developers. At a quick glance, most of the naming is quite good. The only thing that stumped me was that showModal doesn't explain which modal it displays: however, I later found that this was a way to display multiple types of notification modals using one base function, so there doesn't need to be dozens of modal variables throughout the file, which is a good design choice. Overall, the file would not be difficult to understand for developers, but it might take a minute or two to process where each piece fits in. Each of the functions reflects the simplest way to achieve a certain functionality that we chose in the design, and there is very little, if anything, that is unnecessary or overly complex. I also made sure to remove some comments that would most likely not be followed-up on, just to improve the presentation of the file.

- Login.js: The file itself is simple, but still quite compact, and does not take up more space than it needs. In general, it seems to follow our design principles, as well as our general app design. The functions all seem to be highly interconnected in their function, and nothing stands out as unnecessary or overly complex. In fact, each function is simple to understand. The naming conventions are also easily understandable, as they reflect their uses exactly. There are a few comments, which are quite informative, but I added a few for good measure where they might be needed. The file is definitely understandable for any developers looking at it, since this was my first time looking at it, and I understood perfectly what each part means. I also removed some commented out sections of code that were no longer necessary. 

- UserProfile.js: Similar to Login, the file is quite simple and compact. In general, it seems to follow our design principles, as well as our general app design. The few functions are basic and understandable. The functions all seem to be highly interconnected in their function, and nothing stands out as unnecessary or overly complex. The naming conventions are also very good for a form, as there are many fields, and some fields that are similar to each other. However, I was able to distinguish each variable/React element and match it with its counterpart in the client. The file is a bit long and has many repeated portions of code to render each input text box, which may be unavoidable due to the nature of having a form with about a dozen unique fields to keep track of. The amount of repetitive code was actually reduced, by using one function to set each useState variable, which was a very smart way of avoiding having a dozen setter functions and variables set up in the same file. The file is very easy to understand, and future developers would not have any difficulty understanding.

### Code Review - Zixuan: Dashboard.js, Home.js, OrderListItem.js, ConfirmationListItem.js

- Dashboard.js: 1) Design: The code imports and utilizes various libraries and components, which suggests a modular approach. This is good practice in modern JavaScript applications, particularly those using React. 2) Complexity: The initial glimpse shows a standard structure for a React component file with external dependencies, and this is the same as the other code styles in our project. 3) Naming: The names of the imports suggest that they are clearly named and self-explanatory, which is good practice. For instance, OrderListItem and ConfirmationListItem likely represent list items for orders and confirmations, respectively. 4) Comments: The provided snippet doesn't contain any comments. I added some comments to it to make it more understandable. 5) Style: The code follows standard JavaScript and React conventions in the snippet provided, like using camelCase for variable names and importing dependencies at the top of the file, and the rest of the code also follows the same convention. In summary, from the initial look, the code appears well-structured and follows common practices in JavaScript and React development.

- Home.js: 1)Design: The use of external libraries like reactstrap suggests an adherence to modern UI design practices, which is a positive sign. The modular import structure is also beneficial for maintainability. 2) Complexity: The initial part of the code is straightforward, focusing on importing necessary modules and assets, which should be relatively easy for other developers to understand. The use of modern React features like hooks is a good sign of keeping up with current best practices. 3) Naming: The naming of imports and assets appears clear and descriptive, which is good for code readability and maintenance. For instance, animation, friends, and shopping likely represent specific images relevant to the component's UI. 4) Comments: The snippet does not include comments, but since the file is pretty simple, the developers should understand easily without having to know extra information. 5) Style: As the same as the Dashboard.js, the code follows standard React and JavaScript practices, which ensures the maintainability. In conclusion, the Home.js file seems well-organized and uses modern React practices with a clear focus on UI layout and design. 

- OrderListItem.js: 1) Design: The component structure aligns with React's modular design philosophy. However, its effectiveness in the broader application context (like how it integrates with the order list and user data) needs further examination. 2) Complexity: The initial look suggests a standard complexity level for a React component. Use of hooks (useState, useNavigate) and context (useAuth) are in line with contemporary React practices. The readability would largely depend on the consistency of this approach throughout the component. 4) Naming: The naming, like deadlineDate and OrderListItem, is descriptive, aiding in understanding the component's purpose. 5) Commenting: There's a brief comment at the beginning, which is helpful. However, detailed comments explaining complex logic or specific decisions, I added some more comments for some important parts. 6) Code Style: The snippet follows React and JavaScript best practices in terms of styling and structure. The use of external CSS and structured imports is good. However, consistency across the whole file is key. In conclusion, OrderListItem.js demonstrates a component-centric, modular approach typical in React development, with a focus on user interaction and data presentation. 

- ConfirmationListItem.js: This is a simple page and contains fewer functionalities compared to others. It appears to render individual items in a confirmation list, with capabilities to display and format time, handle click events, and visually represent the status of an item. 1) Design: Same as the other files, the structure follows standard React component design, utilizing hooks for state management and reactstrap for UI elements. 2) Naming: Names like convertTime and getStatus are descriptive, aiding in understanding the component's functionality. 3) Comments: The snippet includes minimal comments, but they should be enough for the developers to get familiar with its functionalities. 4) Code Style: The structure adheres to standard React and JavaScript practices. The external CSS import and structured component format are positive signs. In conclusion, ConfirmationListItem.js is a functional component in our project, and it is designed to handle and display confirmation list items in an application.

### Code Review - Shichang: OrderItem.css, Admin.js, Checkout.js, CreateGroup.js

- OrderItem.css: The code is straightforward and easy to follow. The CSS classes are well-named, indicating their function. CSS and HTML typically don't have automated tests like backend code. Regarding naming, class names like .menu-button, .order-box are clear and descriptive. There are no comments , but CSS and HTML are often self-explanatory. The code follows common CSS practices, with consistent indentation and spacing. Jiashu is the main coder for this file.

- Admin.js: The structure of your Admin component demonstrates a clear and logical layout, integrating a sidebar, navbar, and footer which indicates thoughtful design. However, there's a potential for further improvement in the component's architecture. The Admin component appears to handle multiple responsibilities, including layout management, scroll effect logic, and route handling. This multi-faceted approach might lead to challenges in scalability and maintainability. It could be beneficial to break down the Admin component into smaller, more focused components, enhancing readability and reusability fi the project grows larger. While the naming convention used in the code is consistent and clear, some variable names, such as ps, lack descriptiveness. More expressive names would enhance the code's readability and maintainability. Additionally, the code would benefit from comments, especially in complex sections. Descriptive comments would provide valuable context and make the code more accessible to other developers, particularly in explaining the logic behind the scroll effect and route handling. In all, the Admin component is well-constructed with a clear layout and logical integration of various elements. Yuhan was the main coder for this file.

- Checkout.js: The Checkout component effectively utilizes React hooks for managing state and side effects, which aligns well with modern React practices. The data fetching within useEffect is appropriately placed for component mounting, but maybe we should add some error handling for a better user experience. It is a large file with many lines of code with many inline styling. Managing these through React's state or CSS classes would be more appropriate and maintainable. The current state of the code lacks comments, which are vital for explaining complex logic and ensuring that the codebase is understandable to other developers or for future reference. Ethan was the main coder for this file.

- CreateGroup.js: The component is structured clearly, with a logical flow that is easy to follow. The use of a modal for feedback is a good user experience practice. The use of Reactstrap for UI components ensures a consistent and clean user interface. The current implementation seems efficient for the component's purpose. However, if the form or component complexity increases, consider using the useCallback hook to memoize event handlers, especially in cases where they depend on the component's state. Basic error handling is implemented. Adding descriptive comments, especially for complex logic, would enhance the understandability of the code for other developers or for future reference. Yu-Chun was the main coder for this file.

### Code Review - Yiran: Index.js, OrderController.js, ShipperMain.js, Register.js, Map.js, shipper/Dashboard.js

- Index.js: The code is well-structured for React applicataion, using the React Router for navigation and context providers for state management. But we could consider separating the routing logic into a dedicated component to declutter Index.js and enhance readability. The code is quite straightforward, defining routes and wrapping the application in necessary context providers. There's no indication of tests in this snippet. The naming of components and imports is clear and follows common conventions. Generally, The main areas for improvement are in testing, documentation, and potentially refactoring for better import management and separation of concerns. The use of context providers and routing is well done.

- OrderController.js: The use of a class to encapsulate the order-related actions is a good approach, maintaining a clear structure and separation of concerns. It might be beneficial to abstract the error handling and response formatting into separate middleware or utility functions to reduce repetition and improve maintainability. The methods are straightforward and perform clear, singular tasks. There's repeated code in error handling and status checks. This can be simplified by creating utility functions or middleware for common tasks like error handling or user authorization checks. Names for methods and variables are clear and descriptive.

- ShipperMain.js: The component is structured well, using hooks for state management and effect for data fetching. The use of Reactstrap components ensures a consistent UI design. The component is relatively simple and straightforward, focusing solely on displaying data in a table. The naming for variables and functions is clear and descriptive. I think the main areas for improvement are in maintaining consistent code styling, enhancing test coverage, and possibly abstracting the data fetching to a separate utility or custom hook for better code organization.

- Register.js: The component is well-structured, utilizing React hooks for state management and handling user registration. Maybe if breaking down the form into smaller components or custom hooks to handle form state and validation, which can improve readability and reusability. The component is relatively straightforward but contains several responsibilities (form handling, validation, modal management). The naming of states and functions is clear and descriptive. There's no indication of tests in this snippet, the code follows React and JavaScript practices. The main areas for improvement could in code organization.

- Map.js: I think the separation of the Map and MapWrapper components is a good practice. It keeps the map logic encapsulated and makes Map cleaner.The implementation is straightforward, focusing solely on displaying a Map with custom styles and a marker. But the code lacks comments, which would be especially helpful in explaining the Maps integration and configuration. At least when I implemented my task, this file is irrelevant, and it could be better for the main coder to point out its usage (wherther or not this file is just contained in the framework). 

- shipper/Dashboard.js: The component handles state and UI rendering in a straightforward manner. The use of .filter() for different order types is efficient. To reduce complexity, especially if more functionalities are added in the future, abstracting the filtering logic and UI rendering into separate functions or custom hooks could be beneficial. This component is functionally comprehensive and well-implemented for its current functionality. The main areas for improvement are in code organization (breaking down into smaller components), enhancing test coverage, and maintaining consistent code styling. Generally I was able to easily add my new features in UI for shipper to check the group order's detail and change the status, and it will also reflect on the update on the table in the dashboard. By modifying the filters to ket it display the group orders with different status changed by shipper.The handler and corresponding consts are well separated. In the return block, I understand the structure of the tables and I'm able to create more tables to show the orders in different status.

### Code Review - Yuhan: GroupOrderDetails.js, UserController.js, ShipmentController.js, PaymentController.js

- GroupOrderDetails.js: 
This file is used for displaying and managing the details of a group order within this application. It utilizes the useParams hook to get the id of the group order from the URL parameters. It defines a state variable groupOrder to store the details of the group order, initialized as an empty array. Using the useEffect hook, it performs a side effect to fetch the group order data from a specified API endpoint when the component mounts or when the id changes. The response from the API call is expected to contain the GroupOrder object, which is then set to the state variable groupOrder.  There are two main functions: acceptGroupOrder: A function to send a PUT request to an API endpoint to accept the group order. After successful acceptance, the page is reloaded.completeGroupOrder: A function to send a PUT request to an API endpoint to complete the group order. After successful completion, the page is reloaded.
For UI, The component returns a JSX layout wrapped in a div with the class content. It conditionally renders a Row and Col from reactstrap containing a Card with CardHeader and CardBody if groupOrder is not null. The card displays the details of the group order and a list of individual orders using DataTable from primereact. The DataTable is wrapped inside a ScrollPanel for better UX in case of overflow.
It conditionally renders buttons for accepting or completing the group order depending on the status property of the groupOrder. If groupOrder is null, it displays a loading message.
- UserController.js: 
The controller manages user-related actions such as registering, logging in, logging out, retrieving the current user's information, and updating user details. There are few methods in the UserController class:
registerUser: Registers a new user. It checks if the user with the given email already exists. If the email is taken, it returns a 400 error. Otherwise, it hashes the user's password and creates a new user record. It then signs a JWT (JSON Web Token) for the new user and sends it as an HTTP cookie. It responds with the new user's ID and email.
loginUser: Authenticates a user. It checks if the user exists and if the password is correct using bcrypt to compare the hashed password.If successful, it signs a JWT for the user and sends it as an HTTP cookie. It responds with the user's details and the token.
If authentication fails, it returns a 401 error.
logoutUser: Logs out the user by clearing the JWT cookie.
currentUser: Retrieves the current authenticated user's information. It looks up the user by the ID contained in the request user object (assumed to be added by authentication middleware). If the user is found, it responds with the user's information. If no user is found or there is no authentication, it returns a 404 or 401 error, respectively.
updateUser: Updates the details of an existing user. It checks if the user exists and then updates the user's information. If a new password is provided, it hashes the new password before updating. It responds with the updated user's information. If the user is not found, it returns a 404 error. Each method is wrapped with asyncHandler, a middleware for handling exceptions inside of async express routes and passing them to your express error handlers. 
The class methods use the User model for database operations and the userRepo for more complex queries or custom repository logic. Environment variables are used to access the JWT secret key (process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET). This class is then exported to be used as a controller in the Express.js routes, where it will handle incoming HTTP requests related to user actions.
- ShipmentController.js:
This file interacts with a shipment repository to manage shipment data. There are few methods in the ShipmentController class:
getShipment: Retrieves shipment data for a user based on the user's ID (req.user.id), which is assumed to be set by authentication middleware. Calls the shipmentRepo.get method to fetch the shipment details. If a shipment is found, it sends a 200 HTTP response with the shipment data. If no shipment is found, it sends a 404 HTTP response with a "Shipment not found!" message. Any server errors are caught and a 500 HTTP response is sent with a "Server Error!" message.
createShipment: Accepts shipment details from the request body and attempts to create a new shipment record associated with the user's ID.
Calls the shipmentRepo.create method to create a new shipment entry. If the shipment is successfully created, it sends a 201 HTTP response with the created shipment data. If the shipment creation fails, it sends a 442 HTTP response with a "Create shipment failed!" message. Server errors are handled similarly to the getShipment method. 
upsertShipment: Handles the "upsert" operation, which is a combination of "update" and "insert". It updates existing shipment information if it exists or creates a new shipment if it does not. It first tries to fetch the existing shipment data. If found, it updates the shipment data with the provided details. If not found, it creates a new shipment entry with the given details. Upon success, it sends a 200 HTTP response with the shipment data. Errors are logged to the console and result in a 500 HTTP response with a "Server Error!" message.
Each method is wrapped with asyncHandler, which is a middleware that simplifies error handling in async routes by catching exceptions and passing them to Express's error handling middleware.
The class is meant to be used in an Express.js application where it can be imported and its methods can be used as route handlers for respective API endpoints related to shipments. The shipmentRepo and userRepo are repositories that abstract the data access logic for shipments and users, respectively.
- PaymentController.js:
This file is for managing payment information associated with user accounts. The controller includes methods to get, create, update, and upsert payment details. Here's what each method does:
getPayment: Retrieves the payment information for a user using the user's ID stored in req.user.id. If the payment information is not found, it responds with a 404 status code and a message indicating "Payment not found!". If found, it sends back the payment information with a 200 status code.
createPayment: Accepts payment details from the request body, including card type, card number, bank name, billing address, etc. Attempts to create a new payment record in the database for the user using paymentRepo.create. If the payment record is successfully created, it returns the payment information with a 201 status code. If it fails to create the payment record, it responds with a 442 status code and a message "Create payment failed!".
updatePayment: Fetches the user's payment information using their ID. If the payment information exists, it updates the payment details with the new information provided in the request body using paymentRepo.update. It then responds with the updated payment information and a 200 status code. If the payment information is not found, it responds with a 404 status code and a "Payment not found!" message.
upsertPayment: Performs an "upsert" operation, which is an update if the payment exists or an insert if it does not.
First, it tries to fetch the existing payment information. If it exists, it updates the payment with the new details provided.
If it does not exist, it creates a new payment record with the provided details. It then returns the new or updated payment information with a 200 status code. Each method is wrapped with asyncHandler, a utility that simplifies handling asynchronous operations within Express routes. It catches any exceptions and passes them to the Express error handling middleware. 
The class methods make use of paymentRepo, which is assumed to be an abstraction layer that handles the data access logic for payment information.


### Code Review - Yu-Chun Ku: app.js, GroupOrderRoutes.js, Validator.js, GroupOrderController.js, GroupOrderRepository.js

- `app.js`: \
The `app.js`, as the server's entry point, effectively sets up the Express server, incorporating middleware like CORS, session management, and socket.io, alongside route handling. It integrates Google OAuth for authentication and other functionalities, demonstrating a feature-rich setup. However, the script's extensive scope, handling multiple responsibilities, suggests a need for modularization to enhance maintainability. While the use of environment variables for configuration is commendable, further externalizing all configurable elements, such as session secrets, is recommended for security. The script could also benefit from more structured error handling, particularly in the Google OAuth section, and additional descriptive comments to improve readability and comprehension. Given its pivotal role and the integration of numerous features, ensuring robust test coverage is crucial for the application's reliability. Addressing these aspects – modularization, security, error handling, documentation, and testing – will significantly elevate the script's effectiveness and clarity.

- `GroupOrderRoutes.js`: \
The `GroupOrderRoutes` script is a concise and clear routing module for handling group order-related requests in the application. It effectively leverages Express's routing capabilities, aligning routes with their respective controller methods from `GroupOrderController`. The use of middleware, such as `requireAuth` for authentication and `GroupOrderCreateValidator` for input validation, illustrates a commitment to security and data integrity. However, the script could benefit from a couple of enhancements:

    1. **Route Definitions**: While the chaining of route methods (`.get`, `.post`, `.put`, `.delete`) on a single line is succinct, it might impact readability. Consider defining each route method on a new line for clearer readability, especially as the application scales and more middleware might be added.
   
    2. **Commenting and Documentation**: Adding comments to each route to briefly describe its purpose would enhance understandability, especially for new developers or when revisiting the code after some time.

    3. **Error Handling**: The script currently relies on controller methods for error handling. Ensuring that there is consistent and robust error handling within these methods is crucial. Additionally, providing a middleware for handling common route errors could be beneficial.

    4. **API Documentation**: While not directly part of the script, ensuring that these routes are well-documented in an API documentation tool (like Swagger) would greatly aid in understanding and testing the API endpoints.

    Overall, the `GroupOrderRoutes` script demonstrates a good structure and organization. Minor enhancements in readability, documentation, and potentially a more unified approach to error handling would further improve its quality.

- `Validator.js`: \
The `Validator` script is a comprehensive set of middleware functions using `express-validator` to ensure data integrity and validation across different parts of the application. It covers a wide range of validation scenarios for orders, group orders, shipments, payments, and user registration and updates. 

    Each validator array consists of a series of checks that validate and sanitize input data, providing clear error messages when conditions are not met. The script demonstrates a strong commitment to data integrity, especially with detailed checks for each field, such as length, emptiness, format, and custom conditions (e.g., checking if a group order exists in the database).

    However, there are a few areas that could be improved for consistency and efficiency:

    1. **Consistency in Field Validation:** Some validators, like `UserUpdateValidator`, perform similar checks to others (e.g., `UserRegisterValidator`), but with slight variations. Ensuring consistency across these validators would make the codebase more uniform and easier to maintain.

    2. **Error Handling Middleware:** The repeated block at the end of each validator array to handle validation errors could be refactored into a single reusable middleware function. This would reduce redundancy and make the code cleaner.

    3. **Optional Field Validation:** In some validators, optional fields like `address2` in `ShipmentCreateValidator` are being checked for emptiness and then for minimum length, which might be contradictory. The validation logic for optional fields should be reviewed to ensure it aligns with the intended behavior.

    4. **Complex Validation Logic:** Some custom validation logic, such as checking the existence of a `GroupOrder` in the database, adds complexity to the validators. It might be beneficial to abstract complex validation logic into separate functions or middleware for better readability and separation of concerns.

    Overall, the script effectively enforces data validation across various application components, enhancing security and robustness. Focusing on consistency, reducing redundancy, and simplifying complex validation logic would further streamline the code and improve maintainability.

- `GroupOrderController.js`: \
The `GroupOrderController.js` script is a key component in the application, responsible for managing group orders. It encapsulates various functionalities such as retrieving, creating, updating, inviting users to, and removing users from group orders. The use of `asyncHandler` for handling asynchronous operations is a good practice, aiding in cleaner and more readable asynchronous code.

    However, there are several areas where the script could be enhanced:

    1. **Separation of Concerns**: The controller handles a broad range of functionalities. This could lead to challenges in maintainability as the application scales. Consider breaking down the controller into more focused subclasses or services, each handling a specific aspect of group order management.

    2. **Error Handling**: While `asyncHandler` is used for asynchronous error handling, the script could benefit from a more structured approach to error handling. Specifically, the repeated pattern of try-catch blocks with similar error responses indicates an opportunity to abstract this into a middleware or a helper function for handling errors.

    3. **Consistency in Response Format**: The script shows some inconsistencies in response formats and status codes. For example, the use of status code `442` is non-standard (perhaps `422` was intended). Ensuring consistency in how responses and errors are handled would improve the API's reliability and predictability.

    4. **Security and Permissions Check**: In methods like `updateGroupOrder` and `removeFromGroupOrder`, there are checks for user permissions. It's crucial to ensure these checks are robust and cover all edge cases to prevent unauthorized access or modifications.

    5. **Use of Hardcoded Values**: The script contains hardcoded values, such as the URL in the `inviteToGroupOrder` method. It’s recommended to externalize such values to configuration files or environment variables, making the code more adaptable and secure.

    6. **Logging**: There is inconsistent use of logging (e.g., `console.error` and `console.log`). Implementing a consistent logging strategy would be beneficial, especially for debugging and monitoring in production environments.

    7. **Documentation and Comments**: The script has basic comments describing each route handler. Enhancing these comments to provide more context, especially about business logic and error handling, would be beneficial.

    In summary, while the `GroupOrderController.js` effectively handles a range of crucial functionalities, focusing on separation of concerns, standardized error handling, security, and better documentation would significantly enhance its clarity, maintainability, and robustness.

- `GroupOrderRepository.js`: \
The `GroupOrderRepository.js` script serves as a data access layer in the application, providing functions to interact with the `GroupOrder` model. It encapsulates various functionalities such as retrieving all group orders, creating new orders, updating existing orders, and fetching detailed information about specific orders.

    Key observations and recommendations for this script include:

    1. **Functionality and Structure**: The script offers a comprehensive set of functions to interact with the database, covering most of the necessary CRUD operations. This structure is beneficial for maintaining a clean separation between the business logic and data access code.

    2. **Use of Mongoose Methods**: The script effectively uses Mongoose methods like `find`, `findById`, `findByIdAndUpdate`, and `aggregate` to perform database operations. This usage ensures consistency and leverages Mongoose's capabilities for handling data.

    3. **Complex Queries**: The use of the `aggregate` method in functions like `getWithDetails` and `getOrdersWhereUserIsNotManager` demonstrates advanced querying capabilities. However, these complex queries might impact performance, especially as the dataset grows. It's important to monitor and optimize these queries for efficiency.

    4. **Error Handling**: The repository functions do not explicitly handle errors. While this might be managed in the controller, considering error handling at the repository level can add another layer of robustness to the application.

    5. **Code Duplication**: The function `getAllWithUser` appears to be exported twice at the end of the module. This seems to be a duplication that can be removed.

    6. **Consistency in Return Values**: The functions have a consistent return pattern, either returning the query result or null. This consistency is good for predictability when these functions are used elsewhere in the codebase.

    7. **Documentation and Comments**: Adding comments to describe each function, especially for complex ones like `getWithDetails`, would enhance the maintainability and understandability of the code. Detailed comments explaining the purpose of the queries and their expected return structures can be very helpful.

    In summary, the `GroupOrderRepository.js` script is well-structured and covers a wide range of functionalities needed for group order management. Improvements in areas like error handling, optimization of complex queries, and enhanced documentation would further strengthen this component of the application.
