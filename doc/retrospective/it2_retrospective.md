Iteration 2 Retrospective

For iteration 2, our team completed all tasks that could be completed.

This iteration was mostly intended to be an expansion of the previous one, where our team sets up basic interfaces and functionality that can be improved upon later. Both the backend and frontend were drastically improved this iteration, as members became more familiar with the tech stack. There weren’t too many user stories made this iteration, but the progress from iteration 2 will allow iteration 3 to have a significant amount of progress. Team cohesion was higher than the previous iteration, and attendance on average was quite reliable.

One small improvement that will be made in future iterations is the distribution of work. Some tasks took longer than anticipated, some took shorter, some members had more work than needed, and some had less. Now that members have a better sense of the tasks ahead, the workload can be rebalanced.

Another improvement is that some tasks had to be completed before others. This usually isn’t a problem, but it caused slight issues when some members had to wait for others in order to do their work. This has been remedied, as interfaces in this iteration will be more separate and numerous, and tasks will be assigned such that there will be little to no overlap, allowing this issue to be resolved.
