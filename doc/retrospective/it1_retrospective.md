**Iteration 1 Retrospective:**

Our iteration 1 was fairly successful: we established many baselines, such as our naming conventions, coding styles, directory structure, and so on, and we encountered many challenges as well. For iteration 1, our biggest challenge was agreeing upon a solid vision of the functionality and use cases of our product. For instance, the member of our group who came up with the idea was unable to attend two meetings, and this led to some confusion, especially with another member joining after our initial brainstorming phase. However, this was quickly resolved using online messaging, and now, each member is attending every meeting. We are also communicating often through messaging apps and text, which helps keep group cohesion high.

Another challenge for iteration 1 was just getting everyone familiar with the tech stack used: not everybody had experience with React and MongoDB, so there is a bit of a learning curve that we are still currently improving on. This is an issue that should be resolved with a bit of time and patience. We are also trying to divide tasks in a way that people are working on what they prefer, and also what they are good at, which is important to everyone’s experiences in the course. For instance, one student experienced in backend development is working hard on our server management, while other students can focus on the frontend, design documents, or other tasks that suit their past experience.

While we overcame many challenges, there were also a few oversights. One                   improvement we could make going forward is to draft more design documents. For instance, in iteration 1, it wasn’t entirely clear what theme we were going to use, or which pages would be

needed. We are currently working on a new design, which should hopefully get everyone on the same page. Another improvement is to better calculate the priority and timing of certain tasks: at the moment, it’s difficult to predict what should be our main focus, as well as what is achievable in each iteration. This is also an issue that could be resolved with more time and collaboration.

We have high hopes for iteration 2!
