Iteration 3 was intended to build upon the progress made in Iterations 1 and 2 and fullfil a very ambitious number of user stories:

Our main goals were to implement the shipper interfaces and to fill out many smaller qualify of life features.

In the first goal, we were only partially successful: I think every member had a very busy week, where many ended up starting later than intended, 
or having a few absences from meetings. This led to some confusion when getting closer to the deadline due to lack of communication, especially when
one person's tasks relied upon another's to be completed, resulting in some tasks being set aside due to the approaching deadline. Another issue was 
confusion over the workflows that needed to be implemented in the app, mostly due to absences from meetings. The frontend is patchy at the moment, 
but is being worked on, and the required backend functionality is implemented. 

We were mostly successful in our second goal: the UI is a lot more fleshed-out than in the previous iteration, and introduces much-needed features to get the
regular user interface up to a good standard. More graphical improvements will be made in the next iteration, especially on the home screen and shipper POV.

In general, this iteration was probably twice as intensive as the previous one, and while everyone contributed on an individual level, 
we overestimated our abilities as a unit. For next iteration, I think everybody has learned from these challenges, and will do their best to 
make it to meetings, communicate with those who have related tasks, and to start earlier so we have more time for discussions and cooperation. 

For Iteration 4, we seek to finish the lingering tasks from this iteration, and to fulfill the requirements for the alpha version.
