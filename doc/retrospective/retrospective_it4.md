Iteration 4 Retrospective:

Overall, our iteration 4 was mostly successful. In general, tasks were finished on time and the final deliverable is a marked improvement from the previous iteration. 
In particular, there were many UI improvements, fulfillments of desired functionality, and we managed to complete lingering tasks from the previous iteration.

This iteration was perhaps the most challenging yet, as the tasks required group members to code at a higher level and standard compared to the last iteration.
These challenges were of course applicable to the front-end design, but other tasks were seen to be challenging as well.
For instance, deploying the website was especially difficult, since no members had prior experience using Render or any other website for such a complex application.
There were many paywalls and other advanced issues that were very difficult to debug and coordinate, especially when services' full toolboxes are not provided for free, 
and their documentation is lacking. 

In terms of logistics, there was also an improvement from before.
Group attendance was quite strong, and was an improvement from the previous two iterations. Members also worked collaboratively and tried to divide pull request reviews
more evenly. Members also communicated more frequently and effectively during class time, leading to less last-minute confusion. In general, it felt like most members
were aware and understood their tasks better compared to the past two iterations.

The most significant weakness our team had (and still might have) is a tendency to complete tasks in the last few days leading up to the deliverable deadline. I feel that
during this iteration, however, it can be justifiable due to the rush to finish numerous tasks and assignments prior to Thanksgiving, but we will try to improve upon this
for the future.

We are hoping to finish strong on Iteration 5, and deliver a good product and presentation!
