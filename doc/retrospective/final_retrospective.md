Final Retrospective: 

We set out to primarily design and implement the group management and checkout system for BlueJay Express, and we accomplished this in addition to a few extra features.

In general, our team was able to deliver on almost all of the desired features and user stories we set out in our SRS document. 
We believe that in each case, our must-have features were implemented on some level, and in some cases there were slight changes and improvements. For instance,
deadlines were implemented in the form of a colored indicator next to the group order, rather than in an actual notification, and collecting information
was moved into a user profile page, rather than being completed on an order-by-order basis.
We were also able to implement one of our "would like to have" features, that being coupons, which also had a small minigame attached for a bit of flair. 



If we were to start from the beginning with the knowledge we have now, it would have been to have more of a focus on depth rather than width: that is to say, our app is capable of many features, but there aren't many features that are truly outstanding in their depth or design. As the iterations came and went, the scope of the app felt like it kept expanding, especially in terms of the many interfaces and features needed on the front-end side. If given the chance, it probably would have been best to start by creating the group management system, and make it as robust as possible. For instance, adding user moderation features, improving and streamlining the UI and workflow for group order management, or even adding a customer service bot would have been unique and interesting features. Features such as checking out, or logging in with our own user registration system are important to any app in the real world, but in our case it might have been better to divert the effort elsewhere in order to best fulfill our vision. 
Another place where our group would improve would be to have a stronger understanding of tasks and deadlines: in some cases, misunderstanding tasks or confusing them with others' tasks led to delays and hiccups in code delivery. It would have been nice to have a method of organizing tasks and user stories outside of GitHub, such as in a custom Excel sheet, since our GitHub project became quite large and difficult to manage over time. 

Overall, our group showed great improvement from the beginning of the semester, and each iteration was fruitful with its own challenges and lessons. BlueJay Express was a large and complex project in many areas, and we are proud of the product we have delivered. We still hope to expand on our vision in the future, and to make international shipping accessible and affordable for all! :) 

We would also like to convey our thanks to both the professor and TA's of the course: you have all been very supportive throughout the semester, and have practiced great understanding and thoughtfulness in times of difficulty for our team. We have each learned a lot, and will be
