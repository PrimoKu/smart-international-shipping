In general, our team was able to deliver on almost all of the desired features and user stories we set out in our SRS document. 

I believe that in each case, our must-have features were implemented on some level, and in some cases there were slight changes or improvements. For instance,
deadlines were implemented in the form of a colored indicator next to the group order, rather than in an actual notification, and collecting information
was moved into a user profile page, rather than being completed on an order-by-order basis.
