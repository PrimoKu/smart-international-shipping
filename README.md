<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Team BlueJay is developing an international shipping app for organizing multiple individual orders in a group to save on individual overseas shipping costs!

This idea was inspired by Shichang, and her experiences with ordering international products. She found that by grouping various orders together in one package for overseas shipping, this would reduce the price for all involved, and the initial solution was to use an Excel spreadsheet to track each person's order cost, weight, and payment status. 

This app is an extension of that idea, where users can do the same thing, but through a dynamic interface that allows users to (subject to change):
* register to join and manage groups
* organize orders more efficiently, and send the information to all members
* calculate shipping costs automatically using our algorithm
* receive payment and delivery deadlines and notifications
* And more!

Again, this is just a basic sketch for Iteration 1:
We're also hoping to add features such as:
* a chatbot for automated customer service
* admin management of shipping routes
* coupons to encourage good deals
* account/user moderation for a better comunity

### Built With

Here's what we've used so far for Iteration 1:
* [![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/express.js-%23404d59.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=express&logoColor=%2361DAFB)](https://expressjs.com/)
* [![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [![React][React.js]][React-url]
* [![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-%234ea94b.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [![JWT](https://img.shields.io/badge/JWT-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=JSON%20web%20tokens)](https://jwt.io/)

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Main Technologies Used:
- Express.js: \
A minimalist web framework for Node.js, allowing us to set up middleware to respond to HTTP requests, define routing, and interact with our database seamlessly.
- React: \
An efficient and flexible JavaScript library from Facebook, designed for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces, with optimized rendering through a virtual DOM.
- MongoDB: \
A NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like format. It's highly scalable and flexible, ensuring reliable storage and retrieval of our application data.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
### Cloning the Repository:
Clone the repository using the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jhu-oose-f23/team-BlueJay.git
```

API documentation can be found under '/docs'.

### Installing NPM:
NPM (Node Package Manager) is essential for managing dependencies in this project. Here's how to get it:

#### - Windows & Mac:
1. Install Node.js: \
Download the installer from **[Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en)**. This will install both Node.js and npm. Follow the prompts in the installer to complete the installation.

2. Verify Installation:
    - Open your terminal or command prompt.
    - Enter `node -v` and `npm -v`.
    - If both commands return a version number, you're good to go!

#### - Linux:
1. Using Package Manager:
    - For Debian and Ubuntu based destributions, use:
        ```bash
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install nodejs npm
        ```
    - For Red Hat based distributions, use:
        ```bash
        sudo yum install nodejs npm
        ```
2. Verify Installation:
    - Open your terminal.
    - Enter `node -v` and `npm -v`.
    - If both commands return a version number, the installation was successful!

### Setup:
#### 1. Installing Dependencies:
Once you've cloned the repository and have `npm` installed, navigate into the project's directory and install the dependencies.

This project consists of two parts: `client` and `server`. Each part has its own set of dependencies, which is why you need to install them individually to ensure the correct functioning of both the client and server sides.

For the `client`, navigate into the `client` directory and run the command:
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```
For the `server`, navigate into the `server` directory and run the command:
```bash
npm install
```

#### 2. Setting Up the `.env` File:
Configuration variables, such as database connection strings, or secret keys, are stored in `.env` file, which you can locate it in `server` folder.
- Start by copying the provided `.env.example` file to create your own `.env` file.
- Populate the `.env` file based on the guildlines below:
  - `LocalHostPort`:\
  Specify the port other than 3000 you'd like the server to run on. E.g., 8080.
  - `DB_CONNECTION_STRING`: \
  This is the connection string for MongoDB. The connection string for MongoDB is provided in the `.env.example` file. You can use it directly to connect to the provided database.
  - `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`: \
  This is a secret key for token-based authentication. To generate a secret, run the command provided in `.env.example`:
      ```bash
      node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
      ```
      Copy the output and paste it as the value for `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`.
    
There is another `.env` file needed for the 'client' folder, with the following fields: 
- REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080
- REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=110092633486-irit56mv86as5eloift7coseep94icn6.apps.googleusercontent.com
- REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=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

#### 3. Starting App
To launch the app correctly, you need to start both the `client` and `server` individually. \
Navigate to both `client` and `server` directories with two terminals, run both of them using this command:
```bash
npm start
```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Iteration 3:
1) A new type of user, a Shipper, is now supported! Their role is to fulfill user orders.
2) User orders are now given status, deadline, and other indicators to help inform the user about their order.
3) Group management has been implemented, and now individual users can join orders, request additions, and so on.
5) ...many more changes, both big and small. Refer to the project backlog!

Iteration 4:
1) Shipper interfaces are now complete
2) Added additional group management features
3) Deployed app to (URL)
4) Added environmental variables for src/client, as below:
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=110092633486-irit56mv86as5eloift7coseep94icn6.apps.googleusercontent.com
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=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

Iteration 5:
1) Google login is complete
2) Tested and refactored our code
