<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Team BlueJay is developing an international shipping app intended to reduce individual overseas shipping costs by bundling them in a group!

This idea was inspired by Shichang, and her experiences with ordering international products. She found that by grouping various orders together in one package for overseas shipping, this would reduce the price for all involved, and the initial solution was to use an Excel spreadsheet to track each person's order cost, weight, and payment status. 

This app is an extension of that idea, where users can do the same thing, but through a dynamic interface that allows users to (subject to change):
* register to join and manage groups
* organize orders more efficiently, and send the information to all members
* calculate shipping costs automatically using our algorithm
* receive payment and delivery deadlines and notifications
* And more!

Again, this is just a basic sketch for Iteration 1:
We're also hoping to add features such as:
* a chatbot for automated customer service
* admin management of shipping routes
* coupons to encourage good deals
* account/user moderation for a better comunity

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Iteration 1: 
1) The first page you will encounter is the login. For now, feel free to enter anything or just enter the app, as there is currently no user authentication.
2) The second page is the Order Management tab. From here, you can add/remove users from your order, and view your order's status.
3) Once you decide to check out, the app will automatically calculate your order cost, and if your entire group is ready, then you may place your order.
4) The app will confirm your order with the date and order price. 
5) That's all for now!
